1. Remove all files that are not needed for the final project.
1.1. For example - all files in main_output/ should be ignore
1.2. makefile is no good I want something else that will work out to make one commend to setup all projects rust and python with maturin. 
1.3. pkg the project into somekind of a bainery one for speed secound to work in production.
